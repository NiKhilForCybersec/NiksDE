                        <p>This answer demonstrates problem-solving, proposing better solutions than initially suggested, and implementing governance at scale using Azure-native tools.</p>
                    </div>

                            <span>Q: Tell me about a time you improved a security control or process.</span>
                            <span class="expand-icon">+</span>

                            <p><strong>Full Answer:</strong></p>
                            <p>"In our organization, we came across a situation where multiple business units were hosting <strong>public static pages</strong> using Azure Storage. For those use cases, the storage accounts or containers needed to be publicly accessible.</p>
                            
                            <p>However, our <strong>baseline security policy</strong> was that no storage account should be publicly exposed by default. So this created a conflict between business requirements and security controls.</p>
                            
                            <p>Initially, my manager suggested writing a script to identify public storage accounts and then split it into two parts—one to detect and another to automatically remediate after verification. While that would work for a one-time check, I felt it wasn't ideal for long-term governance.</p>
                            
                            <p>So I proposed an alternative approach. We used <strong>Azure Policy</strong> to continuously detect storage accounts with public access enabled and restrict it by default. For approved use cases, we used <strong>policy exemptions</strong>. Then we enabled <strong>diagnostic and activity logs</strong> and sent everything to <strong>Log Analytics</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <p>On top of that, I wrote <strong>KQL queries and built a centralized dashboard</strong> to show:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Which storage accounts are public</li>
                                <li>Which ones are approved exceptions</li>
                                <li>Who made the change and when</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>This gave us continuous visibility instead of manual script runs. The process is now automated, governed, and still allows manual approval where public access is genuinely required. That solution is currently in use."</p>

                        <p>RSA NetWitness is network-first (packets, sessions, meta-keys). Sentinel is cloud-first, entity-centric (identity, endpoint, control-plane). Detection logic—not just syntax—must be re-engineered.</p>

                            <p>"My primary responsibility was around Microsoft Defender for Endpoint rollout, where I focused on endpoint onboarding, agent health, coverage validation, and telemetry quality. The goal there was to ensure we had reliable endpoint data before building or migrating detections. In parallel, I worked on detection engineering during our SIEM migration from RSA NetWitness to Microsoft Sentinel as part of a cloud-first strategy."</p>
                            
                            <p>"In my scope, I worked hands-on with understanding existing detection logic from RSA NetWitness rather than doing direct rule translations. We built a detection translation catalog where we first documented the intent of each legacy detection—what behavior it was meant to catch, the associated risk, and the expected signal. This helped us avoid carrying over legacy noise and focus on preserving detection value."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Based on that, we categorized detections into three buckets:</p>

                                <li>Those already covered by Sentinel built-in analytics</li>

                            <p>My involvement was primarily in the second and third categories, focusing on endpoint, identity, DLP, and vulnerability-related detections where Microsoft telemetry was the source of truth."</p>
                            
                            <p>"For detections in my scope, I worked on mapping RSA meta-keys to Sentinel fields, translating conditions and thresholds into an intermediate Sigma-based format, and then re-implementing the logic in Sentinel-native KQL. Overall, I directly contributed to translating and implementing roughly <strong>200+ detections</strong>, mostly using data from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Entra ID, Purview DLP, Defender TVM, and Qualys."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Once implemented, we deployed these rules in audit mode and validated them using historical telemetry and controlled simulations, including Atomic Red Team for endpoint-focused scenarios. I was involved in reviewing alert volume, tuning thresholds to reduce false positives, and validating detection parity with the legacy platform where applicable. After that, the detections were moved into enforcement with appropriate alerting and runbook alignment."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Overall, my focus was on making sure Microsoft security telemetry was properly onboarded and usable, and that Sentinel detections were behavior-driven and reliable rather than one-to-one translations of legacy rules. This approach helped us maintain detection quality while transitioning to a cloud-first SIEM model."</p>

I then map those scenarios to available security controls and telemetry and build high-signal atomic detections.

                        <p><code>parse kind=regex</code> applies regex-based parsing automatically at query time. KQL compiles the pattern internally and extracts fields without requiring explicit regex functions. The parsed fields exist only in the query result unless the logic is moved into a DCR transform. We usually encapsulate this parsing in a KQL function so all detections and hunts reuse the same parser.</p>

                            <p>"My involvement with threat intelligence was mainly on the engineering side rather than leading threat hunts or incident response. I worked on integrating and operationalizing threat intelligence to enrich detections and prioritization workflows in Microsoft Sentinel."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Specifically, I supported correlation and enrichment use cases where Sentinel detections were enhanced with real-time threat intelligence and risk context. I also worked on workflow automation around vulnerability prioritization by integrating Qualys VMDR and Microsoft Defender TVM data, enriching it with EPSS scores, CISA KEV, and CMDB asset criticality."</p>
                            
                            <p>"The outcome was a risk-based prioritization model where vulnerabilities were scored based on exploitability, exposure, and business impact. This enriched data became the source of truth for validation, patch feasibility checks, and false-positive review before remediation decisions were taken."</p>

In those cases, my focus was less on writing standalone hunting rules and more on validating exposure and looking for real signs of exploitation."</p>
                            
                            <p>"For example, during the recent Ivanti VPN vulnerability that was actively exploited, I was involved in defining investigation and hunting steps—reviewing VPN and network logs for abnormal access patterns, checking for unexpected behavior on the VPN appliance, and helping document a response runbook so the SOC could consistently assess whether there was any compromise. While threat hunting wasn't my day-to-day responsibility, I contributed to it in a practical, incident-driven way."</p>

                            <p>"Inside Azure Functions, the Python logic is straightforward: it's a scheduled timer-triggered function that runs daily, calls the FIRST EPSS API for the current date, handles pagination, normalizes the response into a consistent schema, and then writes the output to storage and/or pushes it into Log Analytics for Sentinel to consume."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Concretely, I used <code>requests</code> to call the EPSS endpoint with parameters like the date and thresholds, added basic retry and timeout handling, and used pagination with limit/offset if needed. I then transformed the API JSON into a structured format—CVE, EPSS score, percentile, date—and wrote it to Blob as the raw daily snapshot for traceability. From there, we ingested a filtered or delta dataset into Sentinel so KQL could join EPSS with TVM or Qualys vulnerability data for risk-based prioritization."</p>
                            
                            <p>"The key design point is keeping the function idempotent, storing raw snapshots for reprocessing, and ingesting only what we actually need to control volume and cost."</p>

                            <p>"The Python code in Azure Functions was built around a simple daily enrichment pipeline. We used a timer trigger so it runs once per day, and the function computes the 'as-of' date in UTC to avoid timezone inconsistencies."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Step one is calling the FIRST EPSS API using Python requests. We pass parameters like <code>date=YYYY-MM-DD</code>, and optionally a threshold like <code>epss-gt</code> if we only want high-risk scores to reduce ingestion. The function uses timeouts, retries, and basic error handling so a transient failure doesn't break the pipeline."</p>
                            
                            <p>"If the response is large, we handle pagination using limit and offset. For each page, we parse the JSON payload and normalize it into a consistent internal structure—at minimum CVE, EPSS score, percentile, and the date. We also add a few operational fields like ingestion timestamp and source so the dataset is easy to track."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Next, we write the raw output to Blob Storage as a daily snapshot. That gives us auditability and an easy rollback or re-run path if we need to fix parsing or rerun ingestion. After that, we either ingest the same dataset into Log Analytics or derive a smaller delta—today versus yesterday—so we only store changes or only store high-risk CVEs."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Finally, Sentinel uses KQL to join that EPSS dataset with vulnerability sources like Defender TVM or Qualys—plus CMDB asset criticality—so vulnerabilities are prioritized based on exploitability and business impact. In short, the function handles collection, normalization, and controlled ingestion; Sentinel handles the detection logic and correlation."</p>

                            <p>"From my experience, the SIEM integration process is largely platform-agnostic. Whether it's SAP or a custom-built application, the fundamentals remain the same: understanding what logs are available, how they're generated, how they're ingested into the SIEM, and how the fields need to be parsed and normalized for detections and investigations."</p>
                            
                            <p>"In many cases, custom applications are actually more challenging than SAP because they lack standardized formats or supported connectors. With SAP, you usually have vendor-supported data connectors and well-documented log sources, which simplifies ingestion and reduces a lot of the guesswork."</p>
                            
                            <p>"Based on my work with custom log ingestion in Sentinel, I'm comfortable handling the full process—validating ingestion, using query-time parsing to extract relevant fields, and building detection and correlation rules once the data is reliable."</p>
                            
                            <p>"From a detection standpoint, the approach would be the same as well. Once the logs are in and normalized, I'd focus on identifying SAP-relevant security and compliance use cases, mapping them to detections, and validating those detections against real activity."</p>
